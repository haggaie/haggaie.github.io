VLSI chips design is becoming increasingly complex and calling for more and
more automation. Many chip design problems can be formulated as constraint
problems and are potentially amenable to CP techniques. To the best of our
knowledge, though, there has been little CP work in this domain to date. We
describe a successful application of a CP based tool to a particular
pin-assignment problem in which tens of thousands of pins (i.e., connection
points) belonging to internal units on the chip must be placed within their
units so as to satisfy certain constraints and optimize the wirability of the
design. Our tool has been tested on real IBM designs and is now being
integrated into IBMâ€™s chip development environment.
