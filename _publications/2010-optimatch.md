Today many companies face the challenge of matching highly-skilled
professionals to high-end positions in large organizations and human deployment
agencies. Non-accurate matches in these businesses can result in significant
monetary losses and other negative effects. Unlike traditional Workforce
Management (WM) problems such as shift scheduling, highly-skilled employees are
professionally distinguishable from each other and hence non-interchangeable.
Therefore, the techniques used for shift-scheduling canâ€™t be applied to the
highly-skilled WM domain. Our work focuses on providing a Constraint
Programming solution for supporting the assignment of highly-skilled
professionals. Our experience shows that CP is well adapted to this problem. CP
supports very well the underlying constraints. In addition, the rich expressive
language supported by CP allows us to provide a convenient mechanism for
changing and adding new matching and preference constraints. Based on this
technology, we have built a tool that is currently being used by IBM service
organizations and provides strong business results.
