Network function virtualization necessitates hardware acceleration to 
achieve high performance at today's soaring network rates. Existing 
architectures are burdened by common tasks that are already implemented by 
modern NICs, such as virtualization support and flow steering. We propose a 
new NFV acceleration system design that uses direct communication between 
the NIC and the accelerator and places many of these common tasks on the 
NIC, thus leaving the accelerator to focus on its intended application.
