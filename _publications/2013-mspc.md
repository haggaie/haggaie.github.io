Computing environments become increasingly parallel, and it seems likely that
we will see more cores on tomorrow's desktops and server platforms. In a highly
parallel system, tracing garbage collectors may not scale well due to deep heap
structures that hinder parallel tracing. Previous work has discovered
vulnerabilities within standard Java benchmarks. In this work we examine these
standard benchmarks and analyze them to expose the data structures that make
current Java benchmarks create deep heap shapes. It turns out that the problem
is manifested mostly with benchmarks that employ queues and linked-lists. We
then propose a new construction of a lock-free queue data structure with extra
references that enables better garbage collector parallelism at a low overhead.
