I am a PhD student at the Technion electrical engineering faculty in Haifa, Israel. I am interested in programming and operating system abstractions for hardware acceleration, and currently working on FPGA-based SmartNIC application acceleration. I also work at Mellanox Technlogies as a software architect.
